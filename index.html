        <p>Hello! My name is Emily Hart, and I am a junior International Computer Science Student at Rose-Hulman
            Institute of Technology. However, I was sadly unable to travel to Germany, and am considering a switch to
            Software Engineering. I really enjoy learning new things about computer science, and am excited to grow my education and experience. </p>

        <p> I am a member of the Rose-Hulman Concert Band, as well as a few community bands - Brazil Concert Band and Jackson Township Concert Band.  I am married, and my husband and I have five cats that adopted us :)  In my free time, I love to play video games, read, or draw.</p>
